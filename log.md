### Hello world, I've been trying to learn Datastructures and Algorithms and also to improve my problem solving skills. I tried multiple times and always failed due to some unexpected work. This is my attempt to finally improve my problem solving skills.

## TARGET:
1. Learning Datastructures and Algorithms. 
2. Improve problem solving skills.
3. Framworks and stuff which is required for work.

## There can be three types of learning,
1. DS and Algos (DSALGO),
2. Stuff required to learn for doing personal projects (PERSONAL),
3. Stuff need to learn required for work (WORK).

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2021 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

- [X] DSALGO - Started from the basics of time complexities. Evaluated time complexities of common loops and also recursion using Recursion Tree method.
- [ ] PERSONAL - Nothing for today,
- [ ] WORK - Nothing for today.

**Thoughts:** I still feel like i need to practice more loops and evaluation of alogorithm complexities but i think it'll come with time when I start learning more Algorithms, so instead of spending more time on it , i'll move on to learning new mathematical concepts which could help me in competitive programming.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2021 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

- [X] DSALGO - 
1. Started learning math from today.Completed the basics arithmetic progression.
      #### Topics completed -
       * What is arithmetic progression
       * calculate common difference in AP series
       * nth terms of AP formula evaulation
       * sum of n terms AP formula evaulation
- [ ] PERSONAL - Nothing for today,
- [ ] WORK - Nothing for today.

**Thoughts:** Finally understood the Airthmetic Progession(I think!), it was a good revise session. This could help me solving problems I hope.I started to feel confident about math already, want to continue this.My maths always been weak.
